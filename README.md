# Gesture-Controlled-Mouse
You are watching a movie with your friends on a laptop and one of the guys gets a call. Ahh.. you have to get off your place to pause the movie. You are giving a presentation on a projector and need to switch between applications. You have to move across the whole stage to the podium to use your mouse. How better would it be if you could control your mouse from wherever you were? Well, we have a solution! Gesture Controlled Mouse.

It is a mouse simulation system which performs all the functions performed by
your mouse corresponding to your hand movements and gestures. Simply speaking, a camera captures your video and depending on your hand gestures, you can move the cursor and perform left click, right click, drag, select and scroll up and down. The predefined gestures make use of only three fingers marked by different colours.

## Goal:
* Learn to handle mouse events in OpenCV
* You will learn these functions :
    1) cv2.VideoCapture()
    2) np.array()
    3) calibrateColor()
    4) cv2.contourArea()
